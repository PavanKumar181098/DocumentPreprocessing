You are committed to your Life’ s Task, to giving\\nit full expression. It is up to you to find it and guide it correctly . It is not up\\nto others to protect or help you. You are on your own. Change is inevitable,\\nparticularly in such a revolutionary moment as ours. Since you are on your\\nown, it is up to you to foresee the changes going on right now in your\\nprofession. You must adapt your Life’ s Task to these circumstances. You do\\nnot hold on to past ways of doing things, because that will ensure you will\\nfall behind and suffer for it. You are flexible and always looking to adapt. If\\nchange is forced  upon you, you must resist the temptation to overreact or\\nfeel sorry for yourself. Before he became the great boxing trainer , Freddie\\nRoach was forced to retire from boxing. He instinctively found his way\\nback to the ring because he understood that what he loved was not boxing\\nper se, but competitive sports and strategizing. Thinking in this way, he\\ncould adapt his inclinations to a new direction within boxing. Like Roach,\\nyou don’t want to abandon the skills and experience you have gained, but to\\nfind a new way to apply them. Your eye is on the future, not the past. Often\\nsuch creative readjustments lead to a superior path for us—we are shaken\\nout of our complacency and forced to reassess where we are headed.\\nDaily Law: Adapt your inclinations.
